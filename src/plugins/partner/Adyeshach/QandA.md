## What is this plugin?
Adyeshach is a plugin for the Bukkit platform that allows you to create **virtual entities** on your server.

### What is a virtual entity?
A virtual entity is an entity that **exists only** on the player's client and does not exist on the server side, so it **does not affect** the server's performance.

### What can virtual entities do?
They can walk, jump, and do anything that vanilla entities can do; however, as of the current version, they cannot participate in combat.

### How is it different from Citizens?
NPCs created by Adyeshach are all virtual entities. Compared to Citizens, Adyeshach's NPCs do not impact server performance and can achieve functions that Citizens cannot (e.g., Player A sees NPC1 standing in City A, while Player B sees NPC1 sitting in City B drinking tea).

### Can I migrate NPCs from Citizens?
Yes, see the [wiki](https://plugins.ptms.ink/plugin/adyeshach/start/migration) for details.

### What other highlights does it have?
Adyeshach is not just an NPC plugin. Since it has a built-in virtual entity handling module, you can use it for any feature that requires entities but you don't want to cause performance consumption, such as player skill effects.
